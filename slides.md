## Outline

- What is a unikernel
- So what - why are we talking about this?
- Opportunity
    - Stop using C
    - Stop building monoliths
    - Start paying attention to security
    -
- SSL vulnerabilities
    - Heartbleed (OpenSSL)
    - POODLE (multiple libraries)

- Heterogeneity - justifies rewrites/cleanroom (on security
  vulnerabilities, code reuse is as bad as reduced diversity in
  nature)
